# 🌸 Bhavya Patha – Making Devotees' Path Safe and Smooth

**Bhavya Patha** is a platform built during HackOdisha 5.0 to help pilgrims at the Jagannath Temple, Puri.
Our goal is simple → *“Experience Darshan, Not the Jam.”*

We use **AI + crowd data** to provide:

* 👥 **Live Crowd Detection** – AI counts people in different temple zones.
* ⏳ **Wait-Time Estimation** – Pilgrims can see how long darshan might take.
* 🌡️ **Heatmaps** – Color-coded view of crowd levels (Green = Low, Red = High).
* 📢 **Congestion Reporting** – Devotees can report congestion and improve accuracy.

## ✨ Features

* **Live Crowd Map** → See which temple areas are busy.
* **Darshan Wait Time** → Plan your visit with estimated waiting time.
* **Community Reports** → Users can update congestion info.
* **Made in Odisha** with ❤ for pilgrims everywhere.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. Cameras (or videos) capture crowd movement.
2. Our AI model counts the number of people.
3. System estimates wait time and generates a heatmap.
4. Website shows crowd levels + alerts for safe planning.

## 🚀 Tech (kept simple!)

* **AI/ML (YOLO)** → detects people in live video.
* **Python + OpenCV** → powers the AI engine.
* **Google Maps API** → live map display.
* **Frontend Website** → user-friendly dashboard.
